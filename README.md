## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the full deliverables for our MSDS Capstone project, completed as part of the final capstone requirement for the Master of Science in Data Science program. The project integrates skills across the three core pillars of the MSDS curriculum:

| Pillar | Focus Areas |
|---|---|
| 📊 **Business** | Strategic thinking, consulting, stakeholder communication, business planning |
| 🤖 **Modeling** | Statistical analysis, machine learning, model evaluation, and insights |
| 💻 **Information Technology** | Data pipelines, system design, implementation, and deployment |

---

## 🏢 Business Case

> _Briefly describe the industry, problem statement, and business context here._

- **Industry:** `[e.g., Healthcare / Finance / Retail / etc.]`
- **Problem Statement:** `[1–2 sentences describing the core business problem]`
- **Strategic Objective:** `[What competitive or operational advantage does this project deliver?]`

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Business Understanding** — Defined the problem scope, KPIs, and success criteria in collaboration with stakeholders.
2. **Data Acquisition & Engineering** — Identified, collected, and built pipelines for all relevant data sources.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — Uncovered patterns, anomalies, and key relationships within the data.
4. **Modeling** — Developed, trained, and iterated on predictive/analytical models.
5. **Evaluation** — Assessed model performance against business-defined success metrics.
6. **Implementation Planning** — Outlined a deployment strategy, organizational considerations, and scalability roadmap.
7. **Communication** — Delivered findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
